### Smoke System
A smoke system that can be equipped to the gun slot.

 - A 200 liter smoke oil tank is installed in place of the gun. The oil is routed to a nozzle that sprays it into the left engine exhaust, where it burns to create the smoke.
 - Smoke is only visible when the left engine is running and the afterburner is not engaged. The extreme heat of the afterburner causes the oil to vaporize instantly.
 - Four different smoke colors are available (white, red, green, and blue).
 - The tank has enough capacity for 20 total minutes of use and can be reloaded.
 - The countermeasure controls are replaced with smoke controls.
    - Use the smoke panel to arm/pressurize the system.
    - Use the throttle forward thumb button (chaff/flare) to turn the system on, and the throttle aft thumb button (unused in the base game) to turn it off.

### Additional Modifications
These modifications are always present, but can be individually disabled in the mod settings if desired.
##### Side Mirrors
 - Adds side mirrors so you can get a better look at your wingmen. The side mirrors are identical to the top mirror and can be folded away when not needed.
##### Stopwatch
 - Replaces the autopilot panel with a stopwatch. This is used by formation demonstration teams to time opposing passes, landing intervals, and other things.
##### Others?
 - None for now, but I have a few more ideas.
