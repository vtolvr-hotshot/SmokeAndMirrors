# Smoke and Mirrors
Mod page: [https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/kobuhssm/](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/kobuhssm/)
### ***Requires VTOL VR version 1.5 (public testing branch)!!!***
### Smoke System
 - Adds a smoke system for the gun slot. A 200 L smoke oil tank is installed where the gun would go, and the oil is routed to a nozzle that sprays it into the left engine exhaust.
 - Replaces the countermeasure controls with smoke controls.
    - Use the smoke panel to arm/pressurize the system.
    - Control the system with the throttle thumb buttons. The forward button starts the smoke and the aft button stops it.
 - The tank has enough capacity for 20 total minutes of use and can be reloaded.
### Additional Modifications
These modifications are only present when the smoke system is equipped. They can be individually disabled in the mod settings if desired.
##### Side Mirrors
 - Adds side mirrors so you can get a better look at your wingmen. The mirrors are identical to the top mirror and can be folded away when not needed.
##### Others?
 - None for now, but I might add more if I feel like it.

Multiplayer compatible. Thanks to Bertmern, Spring, Fenrir, cgann, Kazper, Snowy Blue, and Julian from [Hawks & Talks Formation Group](https://discord.gg/byneYsHcA9) for helping me test. Thanks to Temperz87 and DankuwOs for figuring out how to add custom weapons.
